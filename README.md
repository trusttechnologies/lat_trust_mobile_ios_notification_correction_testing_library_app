# Changeable noti test application 

- This project is available to fix or add new features in "Trust Noti" library. This has as a dependency "Trust Identify".

- Consider that the references to cocoapods have been removed, although the main file has been left enabled to run "Pod Install" command. It was ignored only to conserve bandwidth, save time on pushing and keep memory project low.


# How to use.

To run the Noti correction testing project, clone the repo, and run pod install from the current directory.
